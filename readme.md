# Background

While reverse engineering AlphaWaves/Continuum (https://www.mobygames.com/game/939/continuum/) i have found out that the game files were compressed.
I disassembled the algorithm and found other games of **Infogrames Europe SA** that uses the same compression method.
There is no real use for gamers but maybe that helps people like me have an easier start in reversing/modding some of these games

* i created a ModdingWiki-Page with some CC0/CC1 infos: https://moddingwiki.shikadi.net/wiki/Alpha_Waves, https://moddingwiki.shikadi.net/wiki/CC1_Format
* My testproject for reversing findings https://github.com/LowLevelMahn/alpha_waves_loader
* ported the original 16bit DOS uncompression code (https://github.com/LowLevelMahn/alpha_waves_loader/blob/fc3269c686726227f3f5c7b044d4bc631ad2e87f/ae.asm#L970)
by creating my own simple emulator to convert the asm semantics directly to C/C++: https://github.com/LowLevelMahn/alpha_waves_loader/blob/main/read_some_file_sub_4/original_port.cpp
* did a cleanup and created a command line tool for uncompressing these files: https://github.com/LowLevelMahn/alpha_waves_loader/tree/main/tools/uncompress_cc
* tested uncompression by hooking it into Dosbox - overwriting the original code - doing regression tests and even run the game itself with my code
* i tried to keep the algorithm as picky as possible to detected any fails or loss of data etc.

# What is this repo?

* Its a unit-test for the CC0/CC1 uncompression with compresse/uncompress-reference data of all games i could find that are using this compression algorithm
* the `test_data.bin` file contains game data but is useless without knowing which part is from what game, unuseable for anything besides this test
* the unit-test gets compressed and uncompressed reference data from the test_data.bin file (given by commandline) and just uncompress and compare the result
* the unit-test does not contain the file-handling stuff for real CC0/CC1 but only the uncompression-algorithm test

# How to find files with this compression?

search for byte pattern of the uncompression code

```
BF 01 03  mov di, 0x301
33 C0     xor ax, ax
F3 AB     rep stosw word ptr es:[di], ax
5F        pop di
07        pop es
```

use ripgrep

https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases - ripgrep-13.0.0-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip no installation needed
inside the zip is a rg.exe file, a grep like search program that can also search for byte patterns

use it on the command line to find files with the relevant pattern

prints on console
```
rg.exe -l --binary -uuu (?-u:\xBF\x01\x03\x33\xC0\xF3\xAB\x5F\x07) "c:\all_your_games_folder"
```
redirects the output to c:\temp\out.txt

```
rg.exe -l --binary -uuu (?-u:\xBF\x01\x03\x33\xC0\xF3\xAB\x5F\x07) "c:\all_your_games_folder" > c:\temp\out.txt
```
